# android-snippets



Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this
  


# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag




*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   * Item 3a
   * Item 3b
